# cloudlab-cluster

Reusable CloudLab testbed infrastructure: a parameterized bare-metal profile
that boots a k3s cluster with pinned, hostNetwork service pods, plus the
bootstrap, golden-image, verification, and result-collection tooling around
it.

Built originally for distributed admission-control experiments, but neutral
to any project: nothing here names or depends on a specific system under
test. The infrastructure provides
isolated client/backend experiment LANs, explicit pod placement, two-layer
image-aware bootstrap, a 13-check smoke suite, and checksummed result bundles.

```
profile.py                 CloudLab geni-lib profile (flat fields, no presets)
cloudlab/bootstrap.sh      two-layer node bootstrap (bake layer + boot layer)
cloudlab/bake.sh           prepare a node for golden-image capture
cloudlab/gen_manifests.py  k8s objects with pinned placement
services/                  stub load generator / frontend / storage (plumbing)
orchestrator/              smoke checks, topology builder, result collection
docs/smoke-test-runbook.md how to run all of it
```

Quick start: `make local` runs the whole request path on your machine with no
CloudLab account. Then see the runbook.
